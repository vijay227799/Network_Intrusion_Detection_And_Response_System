Network Intrusion Detection and Response System Using Combination of Machine Learning and
Reinforcement Learning Models by analysing TCP/IP Packets

Built on a benchmark U.S. Air Force LAN dataset with 41 features, the system includes intrusion
detection using a Decision Tree classifier (achieving 99.32% accuracy), and dynamic response
generation via Deep Q-Networkâ€“based Reinforcement Learning Model
